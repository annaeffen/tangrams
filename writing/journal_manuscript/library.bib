In particular, dependency parsers perform poorly in coordination construction (i.e., correctly attaching the conj relation). We extend a state-of-the-art dependency parser with conjunction-specific features, focusing on the similarity between the conjuncts head words. Training the extended parser yields an improvement in conj attachment as well as in overall dependency parsing accuracy on the Stanford dependency conversion of the Penn TreeBank.",

@article{jerfel_online_2018,
	Abstract = {Learning-to-learn or meta-learning leverages data-driven inductive bias to increase the efficiency of learning on a novel task. This approach encounters difficulty when transfer is not mutually beneficial, for instance, when tasks are sufficiently dissimilar or change over time. Here, we use the connection between gradient-based meta-learning and hierarchical Bayes (Grant et al., 2018) to propose a mixture of hierarchical Bayesian models over the parameters of an arbitrary function approximator such as a neural network. Generalizing the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm (Finn et al., 2017), we present a stochastic expectation maximization procedure to jointly estimate parameter initializations for gradient descent as well as a latent assignment of tasks to initializations. This approach better captures the diversity of training tasks as opposed to consolidating inductive biases into a single set of hyperparameters. Our experiments demonstrate better generalization performance on the standard miniImageNet benchmark for 1-shot classification. We further derive a novel and scalable non-parametric variant of our method that captures the evolution of a task distribution over time as demonstrated on a set of few-shot regression tasks.},

@article{nagabandi_deep_2018,
	Abstract = {Humans and animals can learn complex predictive models that allow them to accurately and reliably reason about real-world phenomena, and they can adapt such models extremely quickly in the face of unexpected changes. Deep neural network models allow us to represent very complex functions, but lack this capacity for rapid online adaptation. The goal in this paper is to develop a method for continual online learning from an incoming stream of data, using deep neural network models. We formulate an online learning procedure that uses stochastic gradient descent to update model parameters, and an expectation maximization algorithm with a Chinese restaurant process prior to develop and maintain a mixture of models to handle non-stationary task distributions. This allows for all models to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated for task changes and old models recalled when previously seen tasks are encountered again. Furthermore, we observe that meta-learning can be used to meta-train a model such that this direct online adaptation with SGD is effective, which is otherwise not the case for large function approximators. In this work, we apply our meta-learning for online learning (MOLe) approach to model-based reinforcement learning, where adapting the predictive model is critical for control; we demonstrate that MOLe outperforms alternative prior methods, and enables effective continuous adaptation in non-stationary task distributions such as varying terrains, motor failures, and unexpected disturbances.},

@article{goldin-meadow_role_1999,
	Abstract = {Proposes that the oral modality of language assumed the segmented and combinatorial code not because of its strengths but to compensate for its weaknesses. The oral modality is not well suited to conveying messages mimetically. The manual modality consequently assumes the role of mimetic encoding, in the form of spontaneous gestures found to accompany speech in all cultures (P. Feyereisen and J.-D. de Lannoy, 1991; D. McNeill, 1992). This argument rests on several assumptions. First that the manual modality is as adept as the oral modality at segmented and combinatorial encoding. The authors describe data supporting this assumption in a review of the structural properties of signed languages, both conventional and idiosyncratic. The second assumption is that mimetic encoding is an important aspect of human communication, well served by the manual modality. Data supporting this assumption in a review of the gestures that are spontaneously produced along with speech are presented. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the advantages of having a language system that contains both a mimetic and segmented/combinatorial code (M. Donald; see record 1999-04113-008), and of the role that gesture might have played in linguistic evolution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

This `na{\"\i}ve utility calculus' allows both children and adults observe the behavior of others and infer their beliefs and desires, their longer-term knowledge and preferences, and even their character: who is knowledgeable or competent, who is praiseworthy or blameworthy, who is friendly, indifferent, or an enemy. We review studies providing support for the na{\"\i}ve utility calculus, and we show how it captures much of the rich social reasoning humans engage in from infancy.},
